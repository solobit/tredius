;; With a swift `$ lein new luminus +site +httpkit` or something of that magnitude.  Luckily, I found the `lein-pedantic` module which warned me for two conflicts in its version management. By now I've had to add some 5 odd `:exclusions` keys to (dev) dependencies or plugins, which solved any malfunctioning flawlessly. Since often you'll find Clojure projects which have outdated or older references, you will probably get more and more accustomed to these kind of problems. Since basically you will have to manage these all by hand, that is until someone/Phil puts a somewhat sane model/code in place for dependency management and conflict negation, you'll find pedantic useful. Often you have multiple solutions which it provides, choosing one later version over another, optionally downgrading here or there to keep, atleast what I did, as high/stable a version of at least Clojure but also the (what you consider to be essential components). Unfortunately, there really isn't a one size fits all solution for now so learn to deal with it.
